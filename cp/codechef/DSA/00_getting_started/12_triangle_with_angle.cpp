/*
You're given the three angles a, b, and c respectively. 
Now check if these three angles can form a valid triangle with an area 
greater than 0 or not. Print "YES"(without quotes) if it can form a valid triangle 
with an area greater than 0, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

Input:
First-line will contain three numbers a, b, and c separated by space.
Output:
Print "YES"(without quotes) if these sides can form a valid triangle, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

Constraints
0≤a,b,c≤180

Sample Input 1:
20 40 120
Sample Output 1:
YES

Sample Input 2:
100 18 42
Sample Output 2:
NO

EXPLANATION:
In the first example, angles set (20, 40, 120) can form a triangle with an area greater than 0.
In the second example, angles set (100, 18, 42) will never form a valid triangle.
